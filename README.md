<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

**Healthy Bites** is a simple and responsive web app that helps users discover random meals tailored to their dietary preferences and meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner). By connecting to the Spoonacular API, it generates curated recipe suggestions complete with images, summaries, and links to full instructions.

This project was created to explore working with third-party APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive UI design.

<h2 id="explore-code">Explore the Code</h2>

This project was originally built some time ago as a fun way to practise working with APIs and build something interactive. While I‚Äôm not actively maintaining it, feel free to explore, fork, or build on it if you'd like to take it further!

The core files include:

- `index.html` ‚Äì handles the layout and structure
- `styles.css` ‚Äì styles the interface, including responsive design
- `scripts.js` ‚Äì fetches random meals from the Spoonacular API based on user selections

Pull requests or experiments welcome ‚Äî or just poke around and enjoy!
