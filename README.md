<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

**Healthy Bites** is a simple and responsive web app that helps users discover random meals tailored to their dietary preferences and meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner). By connecting to the Spoonacular API, it generates curated recipe suggestions complete with images, summaries, and links to full instructions.

This project was created to explore working with third-party APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive UI design.
